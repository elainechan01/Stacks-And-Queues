# StacksAndQueues
This program carries out a sorting method using linked lists, stacks and queues, as the elements are fed from a list, resulting in a nondecreasing ordered list after the final element is read.

## Program Description
The program takes a hard-coded array of unordered integers and sort them in two ways as they are being read from the unordered array. Two methods are being used in this program:
- Sort using two stacks (LIFO)
- Sort using two queues (FIFO) : implementation of bubble sort
Sorting of the integers also implements the use of linked lists, to keep track of the order of the integers
